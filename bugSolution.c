int main() { int x = 5; printf("%d", x++); // Prints 5, then increments x printf("%d", x); // Prints 6 return 0; } /*Explanation:The post-increment operator (x++) increments the value of x after its value has been used in the expression. In the first printf statement, the current value of x (which is 5) is used, and then x is incremented to 6. Therefore the output is 5 6*/
